# OpenGL Visual Simulation

This OpenGL Simulation is a mock up to demonstrate the technology use in OpenGL to create shapes, apply textures, create camera movement, and create lighting. 

### An Image of The Simulation:

## Installation

Just download the project and setup the typical OpenGL setup process by linking the required OpenGL dependency files, and then run the program.


## Usage

You can move around with W, A, S, D characters. You can also use the mouse to change camera view. The elevation can be changed by pressing Q or E. You can use P to switch the perspective view.

## Contributing

This project has been considered complete for the extent I wanted to demonstrate in building it.
